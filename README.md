#  Tech Interview Simulator 
This is a simple project I built to simulate a mini tech interview.
It asks you 4 multiple-choice questions and gives you feedback based on how you answer — 
whether you're ready to be hired, on the right track, or still figuring things out (and that’s totally okay).


## Features
- Personalized intro with your name, last name and age
- 4 interview-style questions
- Smart scoring system (2/1/0 points)
- Feedback based on your score
- Saves your answers to `tech_interview_simulation.txt` with date and time

## How to Run
- Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
- Download or clone this repository.
- Open a terminal in the project folder.
- Run the script: interview_tech_stimulation.py
